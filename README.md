# Ibotta-Data-Engineer-Take-Home-Project

This data pipeline is structured in such a way that whenver it is run, it downloads the data from the link and looks for any new data. If there is new data, its is added to the table. If the table itself doesn't exists, then a new table is created & theentire data is inserted into the table.  

And the pipeline is designed based on the data that was available in link when it was received.

We will be sticking sticking to the database name 'Ibotta' as it has been used in various queries.  I haven't had the time to make it dynamic.  

For future development points, kindly read through the queries (SQL File) that I have designed for the analysis.
